Welcome to my personal web portfolio!

Instead of a traditional resume-style website, this project turns my portfolio into an **interactive journey**. You play as me, riding my gravel bike through a 2D side-scrolling world based in my hometown, Palawan. As you move forward, you encounter my **background, education, work experience, skills, and projects**, all presented as in-game elements.

## 🚲 Concept

* Side-scrolling game-style portfolio
* The main character is me, riding my favorite bike
* Progressing through the world reveals:

  * Personal background & history
  * Education
  * Work experience
  * Skills & tech stack
  * Selected projects

The goal is to make exploring my portfolio **fun, memorable, and interactive**, while still delivering the same information you'd expect from a traditional resume.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Next.js** – application framework and routing
* **HTML5 Canvas** – game rendering and animations
* **JavaScript / TypeScript** – game logic and interactions
* **CSS** – UI styling and layout
* **Ludo.ai** - my character sprite, which was free btw

Canvas is used to handle character movement, animations, parallax backgrounds, and game-like interactions, while Next.js manages structure, performance, and deployment.
